<!--
    Wallpaper service descriptor required by Android for all live wallpapers.

    This XML is referenced from the <service> meta-data in AndroidManifest.xml.

    Note: We intentionally omit android:description because it requires
    a string resource, and plugin libraries cannot guarantee the host app
    has any specific string resource defined. The system handles a missing
    description gracefully by showing the service label instead.

    If the host app wants a custom description, they can override this
    via Android manifest merging by declaring their own service entry.
